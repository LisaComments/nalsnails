                    At Nal's Nails, we understand that sometimes circumstances arise that may require you to cancel or reschedule your nail service appointment. We kindly request that you provide us with advanced notice so that we can accommodate the needs of our customers and staff effectively.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cancellation and rescheduling guidelines:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, we ask that you provide us with at least 24 hours' notice. This allows us to offer the appointment slot to another customer who may be on our waiting list.</li>
                        <li>2. For cancellations or rescheduling requests made less than 24 hours before your appointment, we reserve the right to charge a cancellation fee of $35 or a percentage of the service cost. This fee compensates our technicians and covers any additional costs incurred due to the late cancellation.</li>
                        <li>3. In the event of a no-show (when a customer fails to show up for their scheduled appointment without prior notification), we reserve the right to charge a no-show fee equivalent to the full cost of the scheduled service.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exceptions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We understand that emergencies and unforeseen circumstances can arise. If you have a valid reason for not being able to provide the required notice, please contact us as soon as possible to discuss your situation. We will do our best to accommodate you and handle the situation on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>

                    Booking deposits:
                </p>
                <p>
                    For certain services, we may require a booking deposit to secure your appointment. This deposit is non-refundable in the event of a cancellation or no-show, as it ensures that the service time is reserved exclusively for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to our cancellation policy. By booking an appointment with us, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy. If you have any questions or need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, please contact us promptly.
